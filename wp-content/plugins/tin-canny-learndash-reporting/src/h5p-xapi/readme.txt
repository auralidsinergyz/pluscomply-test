This plugin stores all xAPI statements generaded by H5P in a remote LRS.

== Description ==
This plugin interfaces between the [H5P](https://wordpress.org/plugins/h5p/) plugin
and an [xAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_API_(Tin_Can_API)) compatible 
[learning record store](http://www.adlnet.org/tla/lrs.html) (LRS) such as
[Learning Locker](http://learninglocker.net/). It auto saves 
[xAPI statements](https://tincanapi.com/statements-101/) generated by the H5P libraries into the LRS.

You can use this plugin as a component to make your Wordpress installation function as a
[Learning Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_management_system).

After installation you will find a settings page called H5P xAPI in the admin panel.
You need to enter the credentials for the connection to the LRS there, please see screenshots and
further instructions on the settings page.

= For developers =

This plugin makes the following hooks available:

* `h5p-xapi-pre-save` <br>
This filter is applied before the statement is saved. Plugins implementing this filter have
a chance to modify or add information to the statement to be saved. It's also possible to
block the statement from being saved by returning NULL.

* `h5p-xapi-post-save` <br>
This action is triggered after a statement has been saved to xAPI. The statement that
was just saved is passed to the action as a parameter in the form of an array.

* `h5p-xapi-auth-settings` <br>
This filter is applied as a means for other plugins to provide settings for connecting
to the xAPI backend. If this filter is implemented, the wp-h5p-xapi plugin will pick up the
connection settings from there and operate in the background, i.e. not show any settings
page. The filter function should return an array contining the 
keys `endpoint_url`, `username` and `password`.
