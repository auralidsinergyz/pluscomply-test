### DEVELOPER OPTIONS

The videos (aiovg_videos) belong to a WordPress Custom Post Type. Similarly, the categories (aiovg_categories) and tags (aiovg_tags) belong to the WordPress Custom Taxonomy. The plugin doesn't use any custom tables and the settings are stored in the WP_Options table using the WordPress SETTINGS API. In short, the plugin has been developed completely using the WordPress CORE features. So, if you're a WordPress developer, you can customize/extend the plugin as you like using the WordPress hooks system easily.

Similarly, the front-end gallery layouts added by our plugin can be customized by developing or overriding our existing templates. Please [check for a detailed documentation](https://plugins360.com/all-in-one-video-gallery/child-themes-and-templates/) on this.

= 2. Can I upload large video files using this plugin? =
Sure, the plugin doesn't apply any restriction on the uploaded file size. If you're not able to upload large files, then it must be your server configuration that is not suitable for large file uploads. Simply write to your HOST and ask them to increase the upload file size limit.

Yes, you can. Kindly refer to the instructions below,

1. [Popup](https://plugins360.com/all-in-one-video-gallery/popup/)

Yes. Simply, generate your shortcode using the plugin's "Shortcode Builder" and add it to your favorite page builder.

= 5. Is the plugin compatible with WordPress Multisite? =
Yes, it is. However, do not "network-activate" the plugin. Activate it only on the subsites on which you need the gallery. This can be done under "Plugins => Add New" as the Administrator user.

= 6. The download button in the plugin is not working. =
The download option works only on the "Self Hosted / External URL" source type. Even if the video is self-hosted, the video file must be publicly accessible to download. So, make sure that your file is publicly accessible.
